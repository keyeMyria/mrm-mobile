The MRM (Meeting Room Management) Android app.

## Project Setup

This project is built with Gradle, the [Android Gradle plugin](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide). Follow the steps below to set up the project locally.

* Clone [MRM Android](https://github.com/andela/mrm-mobile) inside your working folder.
* Start Android Studio
* Select "Open Project" and select the generated root Project folder.
* Setup the Keystore configuration by following the steps below;
    1. Create a directory called keystores in your project.
    2. Create two directories `mock` and `prod` within the project app level directory `app/src`.
    3. Create two directories `debug` and `release` inside `mock` and `prod` directories respectively.
    4. Download `keystore.properties` and `keystore.jks` files located in the pinned items in the `converge-android` slack channel and put those into the `keystores` directory.
    5. Download `google-services.json` from the `converge-android` channel and paste it into the project app level directory `app/`, and also into each `debug` and `release` directory that you created earlier.
    6. Ensure that the files are ignored from `.gitignore`
    7. Rebuild the project.
    8. Your projects should have these file paths at this point.
        ```
        keystores/
        app/google-services.json
        app/src/mock/debug/google-services.json
        app/src/mock/release/google-services.json
        app/src/prod/debug/google-services.json
        app/src/prod/release/google-services.json
        ```
* You may be prompted with "Unlinked gradle project" -> Select "Import gradle project" and select.
the option to use the gradle wrapper
* You may also be prompted to change to the appropriate SDK folder for your local machine
* Once the project has compiled -> run the project!

## Running the application on an emulator or actual device

There can be many ways of running your application in Android Studio.
* First off, lets check out running on an emulator
    * We shall start by installing the emulator into your android studio.

    Installing the Android SDK manager is the first step. Follow these steps to install the system image.

     1. Select `Tools` in the task bar.
     2. Go to `SDK manager`.
     3. Select the Android version. (Android 8.1 Oreo /API Level 27 or later).
     4. Click install.

    * We shall then proceed to run the emulator:

        1. Open the project in your android studio.
        2. click the run button in android studio.
        3. Proceed to `create new virtual device`.
        4. Select the category below:
            - `Tablet`
        5. Proceed to the type of tablet to use and click next.
        6. Select the latest version and the preferred API version `27 or later`.
        7. Click finish.
        8. Now when you click run, you will be able to select the device chosen and proceed to view your work on the emulator

     * Installing the google play services on our emulator.

## Java 8 SE
Java 8 SE(Java 1.8) is the current stable version used in the app. Download and install from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
Run ``` java --version ``` in your terminal to see which version of java you are using. In case you have multiple java versions installed, run ``` /usr/libexec/java_home -V ``` to see installed versions.(Check [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46513639/how-to-downgrade-java-from-9-to-8-on-a-macos-eclipse-is-not-running-with-java-9) thread in case you run into trouble while switching versions.)


## SHA1 Fingerprint
You will require a SHA-1 fingerprint for Google Calendar API access.

### Getting your device fingerprint
#### Using terminal
Run the following command:
``` keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android ```.

#### Using android studio
1. Open the project in android studio.
2. Click on Gradle Menu on the right side and expand it.
3. Click on android and then run signing report.
[More info](https://medium.com/pen-bold-kiln-press/sha-1-android-studio-ec02fb893e72).

**Note:**  Once you generate your SHA-1 fingerprint, copy it and add it to ``` SHA-1 Key Request Sheet ``` pinned in the ``` #converge-android ``` channel.

## Running the tests to show coverage

To ensure that a user is looking at the most recent build, the can;
1. Run the command `./gradlew clean` to make sure that they have no pre-existing reports or
2. Navigating to the `Gradle` button in the right side of Android Studio, select the `build` directory followed by the `clean` task to ensure they are lookiung at a clean build.

To run the tests locally the Dev/user has two options which are;

1. Within Android studio, click on the `Gradle` tab to the right end of android studio, select `app`, `Tasks`, `Verification` then `createMockDebugCoverageReport` to run the tests and generate the coverage report.
2. Within Android studio, in the terminal window enter the command `./gradlew createMockDebugCoverageReport` to generate the coverage report for the project.

At this point, the user can check inside the directory `app/build/reports/coverage/mock/debug/index.html` to view the current coverage report.
